                            <p>We have seen the graph of total cases many times. Of course the main focus has been
                                China, US, Italy and Spain, but the question that everyone has is how my country doing
                                regarding the infection rate, the percentage of new cases versus one day before and the
                                death rate. There are plenty of questions, that make us doubt about the data, if each
                                country is doing the same amount of testing, if the cases are being register on time or
                                not, but for now this is the only data we have. I have put Italy and Spain as reference
                                because we have seen that these two countries have been hit very hard with the
                                Coronavirus crisis. I am glad that Poland rate seems much lower than these countries and
                                it seems that the early adoptions of the quarantine are showing results. The result on
                                Mexico even do are doubtful, due to the limit amount of testing that is being done,
                                shows good results. I hope they are really good and is not that the government that has
                                decided to hide information from the people.

                            <p>Google has updated his COVID19 mobility reports on the 9th of April. Poland people are
                                starting to go more for Retail and recreation. The past report was showing a reduction
                                of 78% compared to baseline, the current report now shows 71%. That means there was a 7%
                                more people going outside for these activities. Grocery visits show a very interesting
                                report because last reports show a decrease of 59% but now, we are seeing an increase of
                                41% probably related to Eastern celebration in Poland. Workplace are also showing an
                                increase on mobility, last report shows a reduction of 36% compared to baseline and the
                                current report now shows a 27% reduction. This means more people are going to their
                                workplace compared than before. In the next weeks the activity in Europe will be
                                increasing in workplaces let’s hope the amount of cases and deaths doesn’t increases as
                                much.

                            <p>This is the death rate of Poland. I have been surprise on the last days that the number
                                of deaths have been more than the trendline. This means that the death rate is
                                increasing compared to the past trend.</p>

                            <p>In Mexico the #quedateencasa is now showing some effect. The reduction on Retail and
                                recreation activities has gone from 45% to 62%. This should show a reduction of cases in
                                the future weeks. Workplaces mobility is showing also some effect, now with the order of
                                the government to reduce non-essential activities it is also showing a reduction from
                                20% to 27%. Finally, it seems that people are seeing the important of staying at home.

                            <p>The death rate in Mexico is something that worries me the most. It is higher than Poland
                                and continues in this same trend. I hope these doesn’t mean that we are neither not
                                treating well our patients or that based on our population characteristics we are less
                                stronger to the Coronavirus. </p>
