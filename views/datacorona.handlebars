                            <p>We have seen the graph of total cases many times. Of course the main
                                focus has been China, US, Italy and Spain, but the question that
                                everyone that doesnâ€™t leave on any of this countries is how my country
                                doing regarding the infection rate. There are plenty of questions that
                                make us doubt about the data, if each country is doing the same amount
                                of testing, is the cases being register on time or not, but for now
                                this is the only data we have. I have put Italy and Spain as reference
                                because we have seen that these two countries have been hit very hard
                                with the Coronavirus crisis. I am glad that Poland rate seems much
                                lower than these countries and it seems that the early adoptions of
                                the quarantine are showing results. The result on Mexico even do are
                                doubtful, due to the limit amount of testing that is being done,
                                shows good results. I hope they are really good and is not that the
                                government has decided to hide information from the people.

                            <p>This is the traffic index for Warsaw according to TOMTOM traffic index. It shows
                                the congestion level of the roads and you can compare the average of 2019 to the
                                last 7 days. It is amazing seeing how the level has reduced from 80% on the rush
                                hours to 20%. I can imagine the impact that is having on the economy. Less people
                                going out, less people spending. The good news is that, as we see in the Total Cases
                                Graph all this sacrifice seems that is working.

                            <p>The below graph is the traffic index for Mexico City. I have to be honest that I was
                                surprise to see the result. Even is not as low as Poland on the 20%, it is very
                                close to the 30%. Can the graph be lower? Is hard to say. Can the data of total
                                cases that we are seeing correlate to this action? One thing is sure the society
                                is following what outher countries are doing before the government ordered so
                                that is a very good sign.

                            <p>This is just the beginning of my data. As I mention before I am interested on monitor
                                the economic impact but not only measuring GDP growth but other direct variables.
