                                frequently. This time I will tell you about Trattoria da Antonio in Warsaw.
                                This restaurant is very close to the Novotel, it is located at Żurawia 18.
                                Many times, I have pass thru this restaurant and I have always wanted to visit it.
                                This was my first time and I can tell you that if you are looking for Italian food
                                this is good place to go.
                            </p>

                            <p>The restaurant is very nice on the inside. If you have kids, it is very convenient
                                since they have a special area for the kids, my kids age 9 and 5 love it.
                                The customer service was very good. This time I tried as the main course was
                                fillet medallion with marsala sauce, the dish was delicious. Definitely it
                                would be a dish that I would repeat if I go again. As a side dish we asked for a
                                Salad Paradiso, the salad I wouldn’t recommend, I think there was a lack of flavor
                                on it.

                            <h3 class="text-brand">Desert</h3>
                            <p>As a dessert I asked for the Meringa Italiana, it is a meringue with cherries and chocolate. 
                                If you are looking for a desert this is the one to choose. My son had the Tiramisu, he is a 
                                tiramisu lover, and he says it was one of the best he has tried. You might want also to 
                                follow his advice.
