                            <p>
                                When you start a journey out of your country you miss a lot of things. To some of them
                                you can get used to like the weather, but other like <b>food</b> you will always miss
                                them. That is why for me trying to find <em>Mexican Food</em> was one of the main tasks
                                when I started to live in <b>Warsaw</b>. The challenge for the chefs that put <b>Mexican
                                    Restaurants</b> outside <em>Mexico</em> is huge because they have the restriction to
                                get the same ingredients, but so far my experience in <em>Warsaw</em> with the
                                <b>Mexican Food</b> has been amazing. To be fair I havenâ€™t visit all the <b>Mexican
                                    Restaurants</b> in <em>Warsaw</em>, so I will tell you two that I really recommend
                                Dos Tacos and Ye-Ye.

                                        As it name, <b>Dos Tacos</b> specialty is <em>Tacos</em>. I like the
                                        <em>Cochinita Pibil, al Pastor and Carnitas Tacos</em>. Their salsas are the
                                        closest you
                                        can get to a Mexican salsa in <b>Warsaw</b>. If you just like to add flavor
                                        try
                                        the
                                        <em>Verde Salsa</em> but if you like spicy try the <em>Yucatan Salsa</em>,
                                        try
                                        it with
                                        cautious because it is really spicy. The <em>Pozole</em> is not close to
                                        what
                                        the real
                                        <em>Pozole</em> is but the taste is really good and just like in
                                        <b>Mexico</b>
                                        you
                                        can cure a hangover with it. Another dish I would recommend very much is the
                                        <em></em>. This dish is enough to share for two and all the flavors combined
                                        gives the idea of the <em>Mexican Food</em>. For last, I would recommend the
                                        <em>Flan</em> a dessert, this is really good, just like if you were in
                                        <b>Mexico</b>.

                            <h3 class="text-brand">Ye-Ye</h3>
                            <p>
                                For the best two dishes of <em>Ye-Ye</em> are <em>Enchiladas
                                    Verdes</em> and
                                <em>Enmoladas</em>. The <em>Enchiladas Verdes</em> are
                                spicy, but have a very good
                                taste. The <em>Enmoladas</em> for me are one of the most difficult creations. Trying
                                <em>Mole</em> outside <b>Mexico</b> is really a challenge and <em>Ye-Ye</em> makes
                                it
                                taste just like home. The drinks in <em>Ye-Ye</em> are also worth ordering, I would
                                recommend the Margarita in all of their flavors. For more information you can visit
                                their website <a href="http://yeye.waw.pl/" itemprop="url">http://yeye.waw.pl/</a>

                                Now if you are a fan of <em>Mexican Food</em> I would recommend a webpage to buy
                                authentic ingredients. The provider is Ibernia,
                                their
                                webpage is <a href="https://ibernia.pl/" itemprop="url">https://ibernia.pl/</a>, in
                                this
                                page you can order items
                                that are bring directly from Mexico. From candy, chiles, Clamato and other stuff.
                                Their
                                service is good and the delivery is very fast.
