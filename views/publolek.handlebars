                                        Lolek</a> as a restaurant that is good in winter and great in
                                    summer. It is located at the <strong>Pole Mokotowskie park</strong>. It a place that
                                    is specialty is
                                    grill food and that for me it covers all that is requires in these COVID-19 moments.
                                    The tables have enough space between them as a I always say right now it is much
                                    better to eat outdoors than inside any local. If you go with your kids, I suggest
                                    that you take the bicycles or the scooters because the <strong>Polo Mokotowskie
                                        park</strong> is a
                                    very enjoyable place to go around, especially on the summer.

                            <p>
                                I have tried many things in <strong>Pub Lolek</strong> but I will recommend 3 things
                                that me and my
                                family love the most. <em>Grilled Chicken</em>, the <em>Pork Ribs</em> and the <em>Spicy
                                    Chicken Wings</em>. All
                                this food followed by a cold beer will make your day. The sides that they put to all of
                                them are delicious and give you the perfect taste to your food, specially if you like
                                pickles. The <em>Stuffed Chicken Breast</em> has good reviews also for some friends, so
                                I leave
                                to you if you want to try it. If you like me, miss the Chicken Wings I do recommend them
                                to you, they have always been cook to the right spot, I would just add a Blue Cheese to
                                it to give them a A+ score.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The first time we went to Pub Lolek was almost a year ago, I learned after that, that
                                every Sunday from 2:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. they have organized plays hosted by
                                professional animators. These was just few days after my family and I moved to Warsaw
                                and my kids loved the games, it helped us with the stress of the change of city. There
                                is a nice <em>playground</em> where the littles one can play for a long time while the
                                parents
                                can chill out.

                            <p>
                                The drink selection in Pub Lolek is delightful besides the beer I have try the <em>Cuba
                                    Libre</em>, that by the way has become my favorite drink at Poland and the
                                Caiprinha. For
                                dessert I would recommend the <em>Apple Strudel</em> which is wonderful.
                            </p>

                                If you are in the Wilanow area I recommend you this place call <a

                                in the perfect spot of the bike ride, and they have excellent food. The pizza is one of
                                the best around Warsaw. Is just the perfect spot to recharge your batteries in your bike
                                ride.
